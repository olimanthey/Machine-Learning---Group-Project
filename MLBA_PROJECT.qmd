# 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within a dataset. By combining statistical summaries and visualizations, EDA reveals trends, anomalies, and key insights that inform subsequent modeling efforts. In this section, we analyze the dataset related to the maintenance status of marine engines, aiming to uncover the specific characteristics and behaviors of relevant features. The analysis will focus on how various features influence maintenance outcomes, providing a solid foundation for predictive modeling.

## **3.1 Data Distribution**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will examine the data distribution of the features for each maintenance status. This analysis will help us understand how these features interact with the predictive feature. The objective is to distinguish which features do have a meaningful behavior in the dataset for each maintenance status as well as the maintenance status itself.

### **3.1.1 Distribution of Predictive Variable**

The bar chart illustrates the distribution of marine engines across three maintenance status categories: *Normal*, *Critical*, and *Requires Maintenance*. The counts for each category are relatively balanced, with a slight increase in the number of engines classified as *Requires Maintenance*, followed closely by *Critical* and *Normal*.

This distribution suggests a reasonably even representation of engine conditions within the dataset, which is advantageous for predictive modeling as it minimizes the risk of class imbalance. The relatively high frequency of engines in the *Critical* and *Requires Maintenance* categories underscores the operational relevance of the problem and reinforces the need for early detection mechanisms. The presence of substantial instances across all classes will support the training of robust classification models and enhance the generalizability of the findings.

### **3.1.2 Distribution of Numerical Variables**

After seeing how the maintenance status was distributed amoong the dataset. We represented the distribution of the numerical variables among the predictive variable. The bar graphs and distribution plots illustrate the behavioral patterns of key engine features in relation to maintenance status categories: Normal, Critical, and Requires Maintenance. These features help uncover which sensor readings may act as early indicators of engine issues.

*Engine Temperature*: This feature follows a near-normal distribution centered around 85°C. Engines classified as Critical tend to show slightly elevated temperatures compared to the Normal and Requires Maintenance categories. This suggests that overheating may be correlated with more severe maintenance conditions, making engine temperature a potentially valuable indicator of mechanical stress.

*Oil Pressure*: Oil pressure is heavily left-skewed and sharply peaks at 8 bars. All maintenance categories concentrate around this value, indicating low variability and raising concerns about a potential sensor cap or upper measurement limit. Due to this saturation effect, oil pressure may require transformation (e.g., binning) or could be excluded from modeling if variability remains limited.

*Fuel Consumption*: The distribution of fuel consumption is strongly right-skewed, with Critical engines more frequently associated with higher consumption values. This pattern suggests that excessive fuel usage may be an indicator of engine inefficiency or stress, which could precede failure. Therefore, this feature may contribute meaningfully to predictive models.

*Vibration Level*: Vibration levels form a bell-shaped distribution with a slight right skew. Elevated vibration readings are more common among engines in the Critical and Requires Maintenance groups, highlighting vibration as a strong signal of mechanical wear or instability.

*RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)*: RPM is symmetrically distributed around 1500, with a notable shift toward higher values for engines classified as Critical. This trend implies that high engine speed may contribute to mechanical degradation, positioning RPM as a relevant feature for modeling maintenance risk.

*Engine Load*: This feature shows a relatively uniform distribution with no meaningful separation across maintenance status categories. As a result, engine load may have limited standalone predictive power.

*Coolant Temperature*: Coolant temperature shows a slightly bimodal and right-skewed distribution. Critical engines are more prevalent at higher temperature values, suggesting that sustained thermal stress might contribute to engine failure. This feature could support early detection of overheating-related issues.

*Exhaust Temperature*: Exhaust temperature remains nearly constant at 450°C across all observations, indicating either a fixed sensor value or a capped reading. The lack of variability renders this feature unsuitable for inclusion in predictive modeling.

*Running Period*: Running period is uniformly spread from 0 to 170 hours, with no distinct separation between maintenance categories. While not predictive on its own, this feature might be more informative when combined with other time-based or usage metrics.

*Fuel Consumption per Hour*: This feature exhibits almost no variation, remaining flat at 100 units/hour regardless of maintenance status. Due to its extremely low variance, it is unlikely to add value to predictive models.

In summary, the most informative features for distinguishing engine maintenance status appear to be engine temperature, vibration level, RPM, and coolant temperature. In contrast, features like exhaust temperature, fuel consumption per hour, and possibly oil pressure show limited usefulness and may be excluded or transformed for modeling purposes.

### **3.1.3 Distribution of Categorical Variables**

The bar charts illustrate the distribution of key categorical features in relation to engine maintenance status. These variables include failure mode, engine type, fuel type, and manufacturer, each offering varying degrees of differentiation across maintenance categories.

*Failure Mode*: All failure mode categories are relatively balanced, with Oil Leakage emerging as the most common. This mode is more frequently observed in engines labeled as Critical or Requires Maintenance, suggesting it may be associated with more severe engine conditions. In contrast, the No Failure category is least common and appears predominantly in the Normal maintenance group. The differentiation observed across statuses highlights this variable’s potential usefulness for classification tasks.

*Engine Type*: The dataset includes a fair distribution across engine types, with 4-stroke High-Speed and 2-stroke Medium-Speed engines being most prevalent. Maintenance statuses appear to be evenly distributed across engine types, indicating that this feature may not serve as a strong standalone predictor. However, it could provide valuable context when combined with other operational or technical characteristics.

*Fuel Type*: Diesel engines dominate the dataset, comprising roughly 60% of observations, while Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) accounts for about 40%. The distribution of maintenance statuses is similar across both fuel types, implying no strong direct association with engine condition. Still, fuel type could offer additional insight when analyzed in combination with variables such as engine type or manufacturer.

*Manufacturer*: MAN B&W and Yanmar are the most frequently represented manufacturers. Some brands, such as Mitsubishi and Caterpillar, are more often associated with engines in Normal condition, while others—particularly MAN B&W—show a greater proportion of engines classified as Requires Maintenance or Critical. These patterns suggest that manufacturer identity may contribute valuable information to predictive modeling when considered alongside performance metrics.

Understanding the distribution of categorical variables is critical for feature selection and model design. Variables like failure mode and manufacturer provide meaningful differentiation and are strong candidates for inclusion in predictive models. Features like engine type and fuel type, while less distinctive on their own, may still enhance model performance when used in combination with other data.

## **3.2 Correlation Heatmap: Relationship Between Variables of Interest**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The correlation analysis reveals a strong internal consistency among key operational features. Engine temperature shows high correlations with both coolant temperature (r = 0.92) and engine load (r = 0.72), indicating these variables may collectively reflect thermal stress and workload. Similarly, oil pressure is strongly linked to engine load (r = 0.83), reinforcing expected mechanical behavior under strain.

Fuel consumption correlates closely with running period (r = 0.75), which, while intuitive, suggests potential redundancy. Vibration level shows moderate relationships with engine load and oil pressure, pointing to its role in capturing physical stress, though less directly.

In contrast, RPM shows little correlation with other variables, and fuel consumption per hour and exhaust temperature display minimal variation or weak associations supporting their possible unusefulness for further modeling.

This heatmap provides a clear overview of how different factors behave which one another. Understanding these relationships can help optimize the predictability of the maintenance status of a marine engine.
